# PBL-1
Repository for PBL 1 code:

batchgalactose.m calculates change in galactose, e. coli, and L-DOPA concentration for a batch model
batchgalactosesolver.m graphs the galactose, e. coli, and L-DOPA concentration over time for a batch model as well as final product amount, images found in galactosebatch.jpg and galactosebatchproduct.jpg

batchglucose.m calculates change in glucose, e. coli, and L-DOPA concentration for a batch model
batchglucosesolver.m graphs the glucose, e. coli, and L-DOPA concentration over time for a batch model as well as final product amount, images found in glucosebatch.jpg and glucosebatchproduct.jpg

costrevenueprofit.m calculates the cost, revenue, and profit for each model
chembalancer.m balances the chemical reactions for producing L-DOPA/E. coli from glucose or galactose

fedbatchgalactose.m calculates change in galactose, e. coli, and L-DOPA concentration for a fed batch model

Credit to Dr. Cameron Kim for creating the SIRsolver, which is the basis of this code which essentially just modified the derrivitive changes and parameters to his code.
